With more than a decade of experience in bioinformatics and NGS data analysis, I thrive at the intersection of computational innovation and collaborative research. I am inspired by the challenges in decoding gene regulation and translating this understanding into actionable insights, especially in the realms of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.

I am also deeply committed to elevating the scientific communityâ€™s capacity for computational analysis, whether that means guiding researchers through new tools or building training programs and workshops from the ground up. Striking a balance between rigorous science and supportive education is what motivates me every day.
